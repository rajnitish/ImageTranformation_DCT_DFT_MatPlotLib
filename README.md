# ImageTranformation_DCT_DFT_MatPlotLib
Implement the following parts of the transform coding/decoding.

1) Convert the image to gray scale (monochromatic) image using an in-built function
2) Division of image to blocks (sub images)
3) Transform of blocks
4) Truncation or quantization (can try different strategies).
5) Inverse transform and reconstruction of image from the retained coefficents.
6) Use Discrete Fourier Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform and compare and show the error enountered for the same number of coefficients retained for each.
